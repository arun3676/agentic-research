# AI Agent Research Project: Transparent Customer Support Agent

A research-ready implementation of a LangChain-based customer support agent using OpenAI's GPT-4 API. This project demonstrates transparent reasoning, task routing, and agent orchestration for AI/ML engineering research and resume enhancement.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a customer support agent that:
- **Uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting** for transparent reasoning
- **Implements task routing** (order status checks, escalation)
- **Maintains conversation memory** for context-aware responses
- **Provides comprehensive analysis** for research paper presentation

## 🔧 Core Components

### agent.py
**Main agent implementation with:**
- **CustomerSupportAgent class**: Modular agent with memory and task routing
- **Chain-of-Thought prompting**: Forces the LLM to explain its reasoning
- **Task router**: Simulates database checks and escalation logic
- **Conversation memory**: Maintains context across interactions

**Key Features:**
- Transparent reasoning output
- Mock task routing (order status, escalation)
- Modular design for easy extension

### test_agent.py
**Batch testing framework that:**
- Tests the agent on 10 diverse customer queries
- Saves results with timestamps and metadata
- Provides success/failure statistics
- Creates JSON output for analysis

**Sample queries include:**
- Order status inquiries
- Complaints and escalations
- Policy questions
- General support requests

### visualize.py
**Research analysis tools that create:**
- Response length distribution plots
- Reasoning pattern analysis
- Task routing visualization
- Quality score assessment
- Comprehensive research summary

## 📊 Research Insights

- OpenAI API key
- Internet connection for API calls

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Basic Agent Usage
```python
from agent import CustomerSupportAgent

agent = CustomerSupportAgent()
response = agent.run("Why is my order delayed?")
print(response)
```

### Batch Testing
```python
python test_agent.py
# Generates test_results.json with all responses
```
